	'description', "_______[img]https://i.ibb.co/6tdGcXp/PXDiscord-Logo.gif[/img]\n\n[h1]Welcome to Stranded: Project-X.[/h1]\nThis mod aims to expand on the base game of Stranded: Alien Dawn. Within the base game you are limited by main objectives that strive you to a specific finish of your save. Project-X aims to give you the utmost freedom, giving you continuity.\n\nI AM NOT THE ORIGINAL AUTHOR\n95% of the content of this mod was developed by Logic.\nI played some of the content, and after seeing it my hyperfication triggered. \nCausing me to open it up and clean up some of the things that have gotten lost or disconnected. \nAnd put my own spin on things.\n\nThis mod is best played on the scenario 'Project-X'. The moon chosen is optional, and here are 3 new ones added that:\n- Slows down the progressiveness of the enemy waves by a large amount allowing you to enjoy the success of your colony for as long as you want. \n- Sends a massive attack approximately once a month, meaning every moment of preparation needed\n- The third moon will cause the fauna gather before the last attack has reached your base. Day after day onslaught after onslaught. This requires you to use everything this scenario gives you.\n\n[img]https://i.ibb.co/Sv2C7Dm/New-Scenario.png[/img]\n[h1]New scenario, Moons, Trade System, Radio and Recruit Crew Feature.[/h1]\nNow you will begin your scenario differently. This is placed a few years after the original stranded survivors escaped from the planet. News spread and the Galactical Empire has moved the space station PX-003 into orbit. With multiple colony sites being managed by this one station, you can only request very limited resources every 20 days! Leverage the shuttle you came in to lure or hire more crew members.\nCreate the best colony you possibly can! Keep bringing them crew members in and growing. \nOnce you unlock the ansible relay, the colony can start to become more and more independant. And meet people who may not have the Galacatican's best interests at heart. \n\n______[img]https://i.ibb.co/Pc3M8W5/Project-XRelay-Droid-Shop.png[/img]\n\nThere is no end game objective, no win conditions. This is all about continuity. \nYour colony has to catch up to the technological progress the Galactical Empire brings to bear.\nWith the right colonists... you may even surpass the Galactical Empire.\nBut beware, the Galactical Empire continutes to patrol the planet. And there is a long list of things colonies should not have on planet.\n\n\n[img]https://i.ibb.co/HTbjQd9/Characters-Title.png[/img]\n[h1]Over 45 NEW characters, Over 150 new traits, Over 60 new health conditions:[/h1]\n\n\nOver 45 new and secret characters with more being produced, all created from absolute scratch, bios created by my own insanity and based around the entire lore of 'Project-X'. Each character comes with unique NEW traits, over 150 and more new traits infact! Not to mention the 60 plus new health conditions... all this with more new additions per update. The characters are balanced to have buffs and debuffs. They are designed to work specifically alongside the new skills and upcoming new skills and are created specifically for the balance of Project-X Scenario.\n\n[img]https://i.ibb.co/LJj6SH1/PXCharacters-Steam.gif[/img]\n\n[img]https://i.ibb.co/7NGPxkk/New-Skills.png[/img]\n[h1]3 New Skills![/h1]\n[img]https://i.ibb.co/X4J96hs/Trading.png[/img]\n\n[h1]Trading[/h1] - Once your colony can boost it's signal (By building an ansible relay), your colonists can start to communicate with their old contacts or find new ones. Send resources to other colonies and recieve trade reciepts. That will let you learn distinct tech from the Civilian Archives! So your colony can live at the galactic standard. Or ask for help from the other colonies! But there is only so much to learn from the \"Civilian\" Archives.\n\n[img]https://i.ibb.co/x2FDf01/Hacking.png[/img]\n[h1]Hacking[/h1] - If your colony learns enough, you can put some technology together in a way that the Galactical Empire may not approve of. This lets you log into places you shouldn't. Investigate the brand new military grade \"Cyber\" class armour and weapons! The only thing stopping you is a login prompt, and nothing should stop \"honest\" scientific inquiries!\nHacking's main lopp is stealing Military Secrets, and putting them together to learn how the empire's military works.\nLots of hackers roam this planet, so sending off yours to explore may yield a meet and greet. They may even swap secrets!\n\n[img]https://i.ibb.co/nwb66Vk/Biology.png[/img]\n[h1]Biologist[/h1] - The fauna of this world are the real reason the Galactican Empire moved an entire space station into orbit! Initial research results show that the proteins, lipids, and carbon combinations are nothing short of miraculous! Originally an expanded butchering system. Now a way to not only unlock, but exceed what was once considered the physical limits of humanity! Common animal species that attack colonies now have hearts, lungs and stomachs to dissect. You cannot help but notice that some animals that attack you are bulkier, brighter, smarter, deadlier.... learn their secrets and use it against the next wave!\n\n[h1]Changing Traits[/h1] - Some traits can now be acquired during \"normal\" colony activities. Some traits are more unique and have... very unique circumstances before being bestowed. A bulk of the added traits in this mod are considered \"secrets\". Some colonists simply hide food and clothes in case the colony is overrun. Others hold much more precious secrets! Techs, Traits, crafting recipes, off world contacts! Afterall why would a criminal tell the Colonialization Council (GCC) their favorate pasttime?!?! They are trying to end on the planet not a jail cell! Make friends and be merry and I'm sure everyone will start to share what they have.\n\nStart exploring this content by researching signal relays, building one and defending it!\nAll breakthroughs are even unlocked after a certain point!\n\n[img]https://i.ibb.co/d5Sbrrg/NewTech.png[/img]\n[h1]New Tech Trees Per Skill - Over 100 NEW Items![/h1]\n______[img]https://i.ibb.co/y8pZX0R/Project-XTurrets.png[/img]\n[img]https://i.ibb.co/cC0cqvW/SECRETS.png[/img]\n______[img]https://i.ibb.co/QrxHtjS/Tech-Trees-Preview.png[/img]\n\n[h1]New weapons effects and equipment![/h1]\n[img]https://i.ibb.co/xDMP4cM/New-Weaponry.png[/img]\n\n[img]https://i.ibb.co/qgyVxS5/wavechanges.png[/img]\n[h1]Reworked Animals[/h1]\n\n\n[h1]This mod mainly introduces new content so should be quite flexible working alongside other mods, the only exception is any ''Animal'' related mods should be avoided if using ''Project-X'' due to the potential of conflict.[/h1]\n__________________________________________________________\nIf you have questions, I have created an FAQ discussion for assistance.\nIf you run into any bugs or issues please use the \"Bug Report\" discussions.\nI do not plan to continue developing this in purpituoty, but I do plan on cleaning up some major bugs and minor QoL improvements\nI have not reviewed or tested all content, but as I play and discover gaps I will plug them as my attention allows me.",

	'last_changes', 'This started as me wanting "some" QoL & guided progressions.... but here we are.\n\n1. New building based on Ansible Relay; the Signal Relay!\nEach Tier of Research past the base game requires one more Signal Relay to be build and functional; to cause a direct increase in difficulty based on how far along the tech tree you are.\nIt causes an immediate & large threat increase, and is required to stay powered to research any ProjectX technology.\n\n\n1. Research is now tiered and hidden based on progression & prior techs.\nMost now cost resources you can generate via the new skills.\nOfficial Trading == Galactical Civilian Knowledge == 1 Functional Signal Relay\nIllegal Trading == Galactical Military Knowledge + unlockable illegal techs = 2 Signal Relays\nTop Secret == Hint researches unlocked after certain points in the game. Discover specifics through expeditions or the below system! Who knows what needs to be built to continue down this path?!?\n\n2. Character Progression:\nAdded triggers (Some unique triggers, some generic) that add traits to colonists.\nSome traits/events are now triggered as the colony progresses and tech is unlocked.\nNot all traits are created equal, and some traits/events are due to your own decisions about what they do.\n\nNote that most Project-X characters have had their unique traits hidden behind this progression system.\nThis makes them less impactful on Game start or joining, and requires you to investigate & earn their perks\nThis is to bring them in line with base characters, or other modded characters.\n\nSome hidden interactions have been placed that require specific characters',
