Within the base game you are limited by main objectives that strive you to a specific finish of your save. Project-X aims to give you the utmost freedom, giving you continuity.\n\nI AM NOT THE ORIGINAL AUTHOR\n[h2]THIS MOD IS STILL A WiP[/h2]\n80% of the content of this mod was developed by Logic.\nI played some of the content, and after seeing it my hyperfication triggered. \nCausing me to open it up and clean up some of the things that have gotten lost or disconnected. \nAnd put my own spin on things.\n\nReiterating the above; this mod is still a WiP.\nI have some development skills; but my knowledge of modding and the Lua programming language are VERY new.\nI'll do my best to address bugs introduced quickly to try and focus on preserving saved games.\nBut some of the changes/repairs will cause backwards compatability problems.\nI will delete the above when this mod is at a place I am happy with, and then bugfix until it is stable.\n\nThis mod is best played on the scenario 'Project-X'. The moon chosen is optional, and here are 3 new ones added that:\n- Slows down the progressiveness of the enemy waves by a large amount allowing you to enjoy the success of your colony for as long as you want. \n- Sends a massive attack approximately once a month, meaning every moment of preparation needed\n- The third moon will cause the fauna gather before the last attack has reached your base. Day after day onslaught after onslaught. This requires you to use everything this scenario gives you.\n\n[img]https://i.ibb.co/Sv2C7Dm/New-Scenario.png[/img]\n[h1]New scenario, Moons, Trade System, Radio and Recruit Crew Feature.[/h1]\nNow you will begin your scenario differently. This is placed a few years after the original stranded survivors escaped from the planet. News spread and the Galactical Empire has moved the space station PX-003 into orbit. With multiple colony sites being managed by this one station, you can only request very limited resources every 20 days! Leverage the shuttle you came in to lure or hire more crew members.\nCreate the best colony you possibly can! Keep bringing them crew members in and growing. \nOnce you unlock the ansible relay, the colony can start to become more and more independant. And meet people who may not have the Galacatican's best interests at heart. \n\n______[img]https://i.ibb.co/Pc3M8W5/Project-XRelay-Droid-Shop.png[/img]\n\nThere is no end game objective, no win conditions. This is all about continuity. \nYour colony has to catch up to the technological progress the Galactical Empire brings to bear.\nWith the right colonists... you may even surpass the Galactical Empire.\nBut beware, the Galactical Empire continutes to patrol the planet. And there is a long list of things colonies should not have on planet.\n\n\n[img]https://i.ibb.co/HTbjQd9/Characters-Title.png[/img]\n[h1]Over 45 NEW characters, Over 150 new traits, Over 60 new health conditions:[/h1]\n\n\nOver 45 new and secret characters!\nOver 150 new traits!\n60 plus new health conditions!\nBalanced for the Project-X Scenario.\n\n[img]https://i.ibb.co/LJj6SH1/PXCharacters-Steam.gif[/img]\n\n[img]https://i.ibb.co/7NGPxkk/New-Skills.png[/img]\n[h1]3 New Skills![/h1]\n[img]https://i.ibb.co/X4J96hs/Trading.png[/img]\n\n[h1]Trading[/h1] - Once your colony can boost it's signal (By building an ansible relay), your colonists can start to communicate with their old contacts or find new ones. Send resources to other colonies and recieve trade reciepts. That will let you learn distinct tech from the Civilian Archives! So your colony can live at the galactic standard. Or ask for help from the other colonies! But there is only so much to learn from the \"Civilian\" Archives.\n\n[img]https://i.ibb.co/x2FDf01/Hacking.png[/img]\n[h1]Hacking[/h1] - If you tire of living under the Galactican Empire's thumb, restricted by what you are allowed to know. Rumors of the brand new military grade \"Cyber\" class armour and weapons abound. The only thing stopping you is a login prompt, and nothing should stop \"honest\" scientific inquiries!\nBut be careful, the Galactican Empire is starting to scan it's colonies for rebellious intentions.\nLots of hackers roam this planet, so sending off yours to explore may yield a meet and greet. They may even swap secrets!\n\n[img]https://i.ibb.co/nwb66Vk/Biology.png[/img]\n[h1]Biologist[/h1] - The fauna of this world are the real reason the Galactican Empire moved an entire space station into orbit! Initial research results show that the proteins, lipids, and carbon combinations are nothing short of miraculous! Exceed what was once considered the physical limits of humanity! Every animal seems to have a new organ that wasn't in their initial observations. You cannot help but notice that the animals attacks are also bulkier, brighter, smarter, deadlier.... learn their secrets and use it against the next wave!\n\n[h1]Changing Lives[/h1] - Colonists now gain permanent traits as they live in the colony! Some good, some bad; all dependant on what happens in your colony.\nLookout for colonists with the secrets trait! For they hold very precious secrets! Techs, Traits, crafting recipes, off world contacts! \nAfterall why would a criminal tell the Colonialization Council (GCC) their favorate pastime?!?! They are trying to end on the planet not a jail cell! Make friends and be merry and I'm sure everyone will start to share what they have.\n\n[h1]Guided Progression[/h1] - There are now self-triggering events that look at the Project-X content you have unlocked; and gives you hints on how to progress the content. This is to offset the fact that 60% of the content is hidden at the beginning of the game! Listen closely, as these events will help you go from a colony to a truly independany City-State!\n\nStart exploring this content by researching signal relays, building one and defending it!\nAll breakthroughs are even unlocked after a certain point!\n\n[img]https://i.ibb.co/d5Sbrrg/NewTech.png[/img]\n[h1]New Tech Trees Per Skill - Over 100 NEW Items![/h1]\n______[img]https://i.ibb.co/y8pZX0R/Project-XTurrets.png[/img]\n[img]https://i.ibb.co/cC0cqvW/SECRETS.png[/img]\n______[img]https://i.ibb.co/QrxHtjS/Tech-Trees-Preview.png[/img]\n\n[h1]New weapons effects and equipment![/h1]\n[img]https://i.ibb.co/xDMP4cM/New-Weaponry.png[/img]\n\n[img]https://i.ibb.co/qgyVxS5/wavechanges.png[/img]\n[h1]Reworked Animals & Attacks![/h1]\nAn animal reword named \"Insects Level Up All Species\" is the backbone of the animal and attack reword.\nNo longer does the end-game revolve around thousands of weak enemies being grinded to oblivion by expolosives.\nInstead, each creature gets more and more threatening.\nHallucinogenic Neurotoxins, intelligent infiltrators, evolving immunities, and more!\nKeep careful watch on how each animal is getting stronger, because missile/flamethrower/aoe spam is no longer viable!\n\n[h3]This mod mainly introduces new content so should be quite flexible working alongside other mods. Compatibility with other very popular mods is constantly being improved[/h3]\n__________________________________________________________\nIf you run into any bugs or issues please use the \"Bug Report\" discussions.\nI do not plan to continue developing this in purpituoty, but I do plan on cleaning up some major bugs and minor QoL improvements\nI have not reviewed or tested all content, but as I play and discover gaps I will plug them as my attention allows me.",

	'last_changes', "<em>5.4 Droid Hiring rework, QoL, Bugfix</em>\n\n1. QoL for me! Misc continuous under the hood sorting and categorization of the mod, to stay sane.\n\n2. Buff General Tamer's Guild Buffs:\n2a. All Tamer's Guild Members grant at least a T4 animal when they tell you that they are in the guild.\n2b. All Tamer's Guild requests for animals now grant at least 2 T4 animals.\n2c. Zander now provides evolved Noth's and Shogu's\nFloki no longer can call down dogs\nKassandra no longer has different call options for the same animal (Tecatli)\n\n3. Removed reference to Beyond Stranded Character that would crash a specific story if not loaded with Beyond Stranded\n\n4. Cyber towers can now try and override the aggression of the next attack; causing a harmless herd to wander in for ~1 week.\n\n5. QoL: Cleaned up Dissectory, Hacking Terminal, and Trading Terminal Trade menus.\nDissectory has only recipes for making organs/alien components\nTrading Terminal for trading anything legal with the empire\nHacking Terminal for trading/learning anything illegal with <em>someone</em>\n\n6. Bugfix: Safes are now researchable (again); fixed bug in prior fix.\n\n7. Compatability: Beyond Stranded now checked when game(s) are loaded. If found, it will set Excavation as a regular work activity. To avoid situations where colonists would never excavate when on their \"work\" schedule.\n\n8. Qol: Misc cleanup of some bad english\n\nOutstanding bugs can be found in the git for this mod.\nBe careful looking too too hard, as spoilers are also there in terms of upcoming content.\n\nWhen reporting, please provide as much info as possible about what objects are involved. The more detail the better, esp what just happened that triggered the bad behavior.",
